  <h3>About myself:</h3>
  <p>Most of  my life I was keen on humanities. 
    At school I used to study history and languages much more than math and physics and I really like what I was doing. 
    I felt like these were about real life as they were understandable and seemed more practical for an average person. 
    So when the time to choose my future career has come I chose political science with no doubt. 
    However, more semesters I finished, more I started noticing that I was studying everything... but actually I knew nothing. 
    Along my main studies, I found myself interested in languages, so was carrying on deepening my fluency in English and started studying Italian and French. 
    I reached decent level in these, but I don’t have any certificate though. 
    Then when the pandemic has come and I had a lot of fire time I came across some frontend course for beginners and I decided to try myself in this field. 
    But I didn’t have enough motivation and reasons to dedicate a lot of attention to my new hobby so when my university reopened its doors I gave it up, unfortunately. 
    Next year I worked in the local youth tourist centre and I had a side job as a deliveryman. 
    And when my country faced aggression and war I found myself in the same situation as 2 years before and casually found free frontend course by ELEKS. 
    Then I decided to make up my mind and totally switch to a new field as I had so much desire to become a professional in this sphere. 
    So I’m studying frontend development currently and in some months I’m going to enter an IT company as a trainee and grow up more and more.</p>
